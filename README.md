In this project I build a **Tasty Kitchens App** by applying the concepts I have learned till now. 

It is a **Responsive food delivery application** hving basic features and functionalities like ,

**=>** User Login,Home Route contains Offers and restaurant list can be sorted by  functionality Lowest/Highest
**=>** Can Add or Subtract the quantity of food items 
**=>** Finally cart features like cart-items-list and total bill decrement/increment cart items in cart route and payment section etc 


### Implementation Steps 

**=>** To achive these files more effective i have utilizied Figma mockups

**=>** Implemented different routes for login,home,specific restuarant details,cart by using React Router components Route,Switch,Link,Redirect etc.

**=>** Used username and password for authentication login/logout

**=>** stored access token in Cookies for authorization on different routes

**=>** Used a react-third-party-library React-Slick for implementing offers carousels in home route

**=>** Used fetch to call REST APIs for restaurants with sortby,specific restaurant details

**=>** Implemented Pagination to get a specific number of items from the list of items in a certain range

**=>** Implemented Sortby functionality by which user can filter list by rating lowest/highest

**=>** Implemented Adding items to Local Storage by using the key name cartData
